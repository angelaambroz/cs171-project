CS171 Project: The shape of text
=======

### Summary

Spring 2016. This project will visualize the story shapes of a variety of 19th century novels. Ideally, I'd like to build something that's extendable to a wide variety of texts. This is the final project for [CS171 Spring 2016](http://www.cs171.org/2016/). 


### Inspiration
* [Kurt Vonnegut's lecture: The shape of stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ)
* [Kurt Vonnegut's actual story shapes](http://visual.ly/kurt-vonnegut-shapes-stories-0)
* [indico: Exploring the shapes of stories using Python and sentiment APIs](https://indico.io/blog/plotlines/)
* [OpenVisConf 2015 video visualization](https://openvisconf.com/2015/#videos)

### TODO

###### General
* ~~Get `git` set up.~~
* Keep taking pictures/screenshots for Process Book.

###### Data processing
* ~~Select texts for download.~~
* ~~Basic input of `txt`, output `json`.~~
* ~~Top-level object for each text, capturing title, author, top words, etc.~~
* ~~Paragraph-level objects capturing para text, length (sentences vs. characters?), sentences, whether they have any top words in there.~~
* General questions:
  1. Should I separate out each book into its own json? What would be most efficient to pull from the server?
  2. How else can I reduce the size of the json?


###### Data visualization
Coming soon.
