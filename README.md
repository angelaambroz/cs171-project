CS171 Project: The shape of text
=======

### Summary

Spring 2016. This project will visualize the story shapes of a ~~variety of 19th century novels~~ about 300 science fiction short stories. Ideally, I'd like to build something that's extendable to a wide variety of texts. This is the final project for [CS171 Spring 2016](http://www.cs171.org/2016/).

### TODO

###### General
* ~~Get `git` set up.~~
* Keep taking pictures/screenshots for Process Book.
* ~~Find CC-licensed book covers.~~
* New design idea: User can search for something in the text.
* New design idea: Tooltip _not_ on hover - but rather, once top word or user word appears, reveal that line to the right of the charts.
* New design idea: The long scroll is boring:
      * Collapse paras into chapter objects? (Using average sentence length per para?)


###### Data processing
* ~~Select texts for download.~~
* ~~Basic input of `txt`, output `json`.~~
* ~~Top-level object for each text, capturing title, author, top words, etc.~~
* ~~Paragraph-level objects capturing para text, length (sentences vs. characters?), sentences, whether they have any top words in there.~~
* ~~Convert all `len(x)` into word tokenizers counting words, instead of characters.~~
* ~~Fix above -- specifically, fix `cleanWordTokenize()`.~~ 
* **Design 2 (SH scrape)**: Fix 2003 story.
* ~~General questions:~~
    1. ~~Should I separate out each book into its own json? What would be most efficient to pull from the server?~~
    2. ~~How else can I reduce the size of the json?~~


###### Data visualization
* ~~Add templates from best HWs and Labs.~~
* ~~Set up some basic CSS and website structure.~~
* ~~Where to put `#main-viz` and `#link-viz`?~~
* Data summary box - get that started.
* Top words ~~buttons~~ word cloud. 
* Get ~~`main.js`~~, ~~`textChart.js`~~ and `linkChart.js` set up.
* ~~User choice covers: CSS, functions.~~ 
* How to replicate Sublime Text's brushed sidebar? 
    * How to determine height of what the viewer is seeing? Highest data point and lowest data point?
* Filter linkData, based on book selected. (Essentially, just remove all `sentences` objects from `text`.)
* ~~Jane Austen `maxParaLength` seems way too high.~~
* ~~Apply `d3.stack.layout()` data transformation to `paraArray` in `textChart.js`.~~ (Did this manually.)
* Resize isn't re-loading `mainChart` in the correct way.
* ~~Figure out `height` on `mainChart`.`~~
* ~~Center `mainChart`.~~
* Heat map of complexity (using `vocab`).
